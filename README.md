# New Features
- A toggle for the node animation property root path thing for some reason
- Animation Indices
- Be able to export all of the animations included in the xml. (No offset and indices settings.)
- An AnimationPlayer xml packer
# Fixes
- Frame region sometimes not positioned correctly

# How to use the AnimationPlayer xml packer
Very simple! You can add sprites to the list then type one of their sprite and sheet path. Unfortunately it still doesn't able to set offsets and indices. After that you save the AnimationPlayer!
